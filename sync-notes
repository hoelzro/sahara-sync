## create and then immediately delete
## create a filesystem object over an existing hierarchical directory structure
## how to behave with symlinks? hard links?
## what if a user mounts/umounts volumnes under the sync dir?
## test IN_IGNORED
## handle queue overflow
## translate / to native dir seperator
## file encoding?
## if only permissions change on a file, conflicts are different...
## Should expected changes persist on disk?
