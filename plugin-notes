Plugin Ideas:
  Public files
  Shared files
    ACL
    OpenPGP for auth
  Revision Control
    History
    Revert to earlier version
    View earlier version
    Permanent deletion
    # days/weeks/whatever to keep something around
  Bulk store/fetch
  Storage
  Authentication
  Blob deltas for storage/transmission
  Compression
  Rate Limiting/Throttling
    Throttling based on time of day
  Zeroconf/Bonjour?
  Filter incoming files
   filename
   mime type
   file size
  Outgoing filtration (???)
  Encryption (client or server side)
   Filenames
   Metadata
   Contents
   Selectively encrypt certain types of documents
  Something to fight my constant :w in Vim
  SparkleShare/SyncAny integration
  Conflict resolvers
  Pipe plugins (essentially, a plugin defined as an external program, with a given stdin/stdout or socket interface)
  Plugins in multiple languages

Every plugin has a logger
A plugin should be able to leverage others (ex. only encrypting blobs that match a filter)
X-Sahara-Plugin
/plugin/$plugin

Plugin hooks:
    Able to add tables to stores (namespaces)
    Able to add encoding layers (sort of) 
    Able to add REST routes
    Able to augment headers on existing routes
    Able to add component API calls


Example: SaharaSync::Hostd::Plugin::BulkUpload

use Moose;

with 'SaharaSync::Hostd::Plugin::Route';

use Plack::Request;

sub routes {
    '/bulk_upload'
}

sub to_app {
    my ( $hostd ) = @_; 

    my $store = $hostd->store;

    if($store->does('SaharaSync::Hostd::Plugin::Store::CanBulkUpload')) {
        sub {
            my ( $env ) = @_; 

            my $req = Plack::Request->new($env);
            my $res = $req->new_response;

            $store->bulk_insert($req->body);
            ## return something nice
        };  
    } else {
        $store = ref($store);
        $hostd->log_warn("Storage engine "$store" doesn't implement bulk uploads");

        return sub {
            return [
                501,
                ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain'],
                ['Unimplemented'],
            ];  
        };  
    }   
}

::CanBulkUpload is provided via the plugin dist.  To implement bulk uploading stores, we can:

# use a role if it exists
# augment an existing storage plugin (using monkey patching, or runtime role application)
# create a new storage plugin
# consider this same idea for revision control, and storage systems that would provide this capability
