Tests
=====

- Repeated pending changes in clientd's offline queue
  - Same blob
  - Different blobs
- FS conflict with existing directory
- FS conflict with exact same contents
- FS conflict with different permissions
- Preexisting foo/bar (wtf does that mean?)
- Sync up directory with ack'd blobs (???)
- Test multiple clientds on the same sync dir
- Test repeated changes and make sure they jive properly
    change X comes in for blob A
    change Y comes in for blob A
    the PUT for Y is sent before the PUT for X returns
    âˆ´ the PUT for Y will use an outdated revision
        Even think about how this would occur in a multi server environment!
    Solution: use a queue for each blob name and only drain the queue in a semi-synchronous fashion
        Is this done in clientd, or AE::WS::SS?
    Solution: coalesce FS changes across a small time interval
        We would still need some sort of queueing
- Bad connection for /changes test

"Real World" tests
==================

- When I saved ss-notes-continued, ss-notes-continued~ leaked through to the other client
- How will Vim swap files behave under a sync dir?
- I think Vim does some funky stuff when it saves to an existing file
 - Writing contents to filename~
 - Rename filename~ â†’ filename
 - It also creates some numbered file (mine is 4913)
- Test multiple (> 3) clientds
- Make sure you test streaming changes
